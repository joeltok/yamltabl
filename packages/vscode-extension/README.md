# Markdown Preview Yamltabl Support

Add Yamltabl support to Markdown Preview. Yamltabl lets you define tables in YAML using a human-readable schema.

Perfect for everything-as-code documentation and static sites — without the messiness of raw Markdown, HTML, or embeddable spreadsheet tables.

## Usage

Add the following delimited code block to any Markdown file. It will render as a Markdown table. 

````
```yamltabl
yamltabl: 2.0.0

columns:
  - haiku: Haiku Title
  - line1: Line 1
  - line2: Line 2
  - line3: Line 3

row1:
  haiku: “The Old Pond” by Matsuo Bashō
  line1: An old silent pond
  line2: A frog jumps into the pond —
  line3: Splash! Silence again.

row2:
  haiku: “A World of Dew” by Kobayashi Issa
  line1: A world of dew,
  line2: And within every dewdrop
  line3: A world of struggle.
```
